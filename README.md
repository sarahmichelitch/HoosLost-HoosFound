**Features included in our app:**

All users:
- Google OAuth 2.0: Create an account by simply logging in with your Google account.
- Profile customization: Navigate to "My Account" to change your username or add your phone number to your contact information. Users who engage in item claiming with you will see this information along with your account's email address.
- Upload lost items: Click on "Upload an Item" to be redirected to a form for posting lost items. Fill in the item's name, type in a location or use your computer's current location (via the "Get Current Location" button), and fill in any optional fields desired (image and description). You will receive a notification in your notifications inbox when an admin approves your item.
- View lost items: Click on red markers on the Home page to reveal lost items that you and other users have uploaded. If multiple items have been uploaded at one location, all of the markers will appear in a cluster once the location is clicked. Press on individual markers to see the specific items and their details.
- Claim system: If you would like to claim a lost item, simply press the "CLAIM" button on the desired marker. A pop-up will appear to confirm that you have claimed the item along with the other user's username and email. To review your claim and see additional contact information, go to your notifications inbox. The person whose item you claimed will also receive a notification with your username, contact information, and the item that you claimed. Once you have coordinated item retrieval outside of the app, the person who uploaded the item can delete the item.
- Deleting uploads: Go to the "My Uploads" page to delete any of your uploaded items.
- Notifications inbox: To view account notifications, navigate to the "Notifications" page. Newer messages will appear first. You can delete notifications at any time.

Admin users:
- Item approval: A unique "Manage Uploads" page is available for admins. To approve a submission, click "Approve" on the item in the "Manage Pending Uploads" table. To deny a submission, click "Decline" on the item in the "Manage Pending Uploads" table and provide an explanation as to why you have decided to deny this submission. The user will be notified of your decision and explanation if applicable. Inappropriate uploads should be denied to allow for content moderation.
- Item deletion: If you would like to delete an already-approved item uploaded by another user, click "Delete" on the specific item in the "Manage Approved Uploads" table in the "Manage Uploads" page.
